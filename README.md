# The Oracle - AI-Powered Divination Platform

## Prologue

Most of this repository was generated by coordination with an LLM. I've done minimal work to improve its standards or its code beyond what I could instruct the 
IDE to accomplish. There are admittedly a number of critical weaknesses here: the vector DB would be much better if it were storing more information and if it 
were in QDrant or Pinecone instead of just an in-memory file. The SQL schema is admittedly very weak and would need a significant re-think, but it does 
accomplish what it needs to. Significantly, it could use a visual redesign as neither I nor the machine is particularly talented in this regard.

### Why divination?

It offers a combination of complexity and simplicity. The rules and outlines of the different divination systems require that certain amounts of rules need to be 
followed. But even if the data comes out of the LLM and is particularly strange, it can still fit with the output of "valid." It also lets me experiment with 
things like temperature and number of tokens to see what would happen. Most of the time, having a relatively low temperature makes sense for most uses, but in 
this case, turning that number up could still end up working. (You'll note that most of the time, temperature is around 0.8) 

I also happen to find the esoteric fascinating and already have several resources on the same. Mr. Clarke's comments aside, computers are not magic and that's not
the purpose here.

### Complete features

- I Ching readings (the original PoC)
- Runic divination in multiple layouts
- A complete set of I Ching images (generated through ChatGPT)
- A sense of "question history" 
- Primitive pyromancy
- A wiki (to eventually be used in RAG)
- System supports Ollama and ChatGPT for non-image

### Incomplete features (so far)

The most difficult parts of this project were getting the image recreation to work and getting the timing around the stellar calendars correct. I would say that
neither one was completed 100%, though I think that it might be a good idea to give up on the idea of a "redrawing" feature for now. 

#### Astrology

For the astrology portion, it seems like things are lining up but I just don't think that it has gotten to its potential. I wanted to support full horoscopes 
along with reading of one's birth chart, but that never panned out. I was able to find a series of documents which I could feed into the LLM (or make available
through RAG), and I was (eventually) able to get Cursor.ai to connect to the NASA astronomical data, but I wasn't convinced that the backend was correctly 
generating the charts. And while this entire site has been generated "for fun", I still wanted to get it *right*.

#### pyromancy

The image re-creation was more difficult. The goal was to take a snapshot of the fire (which I got Cursor to reproduce from some online examples). Then, use OpenCV 
or similar to extract the contors and identify "objects" in the frame. These would then be sent to DALL-E 3 to get several descriptive words or word pairs. 
These words were supposed to be fed back into DALL-E along with the original distilled objects in hope that I could get DALL-E to draw an image along the lines of
the original contors. Basically, it was a Rorsach test for computers.

###### Main problems in implementation

There were two problems that I consistently encountered. It didn't seem to matter what I put into the prompt, the image recognition part kept giving words like 
"flowing wing" or "mystic flame". This tool won't work unless the machine can provide something more varied. Second, the image generation part was continually
reproducing things which either looked nothing like the flame image or looked nothing like the description. This is actually one of the areas I spent the most time
actually directly modifying the code. I tried discussing the issue with Claude and GPT, both inside and outside of Cursor.ai, but none of the prompt recommendations
nor did any research propose additional suggestions. I suspect that this is something which is *solveable*, but not in the amount of time that I've had for this 
project.

###### Cost

Unlike the rest of the site, this actually requires a subscription which supports image manipulation. I tried to look through the other options online and 
nothing offerend any type of comparable ability which was at all satisfying. Any of the open source or local image manipulation turned out to be particularly slow
and costly.

###### Problems in definition

In addition, and this is similar to the problems I had with Astrology, my undertanding of ancient pyromancy practice was actually deficient. While yes, the images 
that someone sees in the flames and smoke are used in the process of pyromancy, more common are the way that the flame burns and cracks. The origin of the
I Ching actually had something closer to what I'm doing here: they would place a bone into a fire. If it would crack, then that would be a "yin", if not, that
would be a "yang". Similarly, the way that fire affects the fuel in the fire is as much a part of the traditional part of pyromancy as anything else. Add that
to the fact that my pyromancy widget doesn't properly handle wind and the disparity takes some of the luster out of it.

### Project outcome

This project was never intended to be able to predict the future. 
(Though a historically informed understanding of divination doesn't really do that either ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø).
Instead, this was a way for me to develop an understanding of what it meant to use an LLM to build a site from scratch by instructing instead of acting primarily
as a programmer. I was mostly satisfied, the LLMs functioned as a mostly capable junior developer. It wasn't without headaches, but the point was to understand
the headaches and how to avoid them.

And now, without further adieu, below is the computer's description of this project:
