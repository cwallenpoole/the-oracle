59 Dispersion (L L G G L G)
60 Limitation (G L G G L L)
61 Truth (L L G G L L)
62 Small (G G L L G G)
63 After (G L G L G L)
64 Before (L G L G L G)

Flipping coins:

Heads-heads-heads =L w/ a circle
Tails-tails-tails =G w/ an X
Heads-heads-tails =G
Tails-tails-head =L 


Once flipped coins 6 times, then ignore the X's and O's and look up the number above for the symbol of now. Then replace the X's with solid Ls and O's with Gs and look up the hexagram for the future.

Each hexagram is made up of two trigrams:

Heaven, the Creative (L L L)
Lake, the Joyous (G L L)
Fire, the Clinging (L G L)
Thunder, the Arousing (G G L)
Wind, the Gentle (Wood) (L L G)
Water, the Abysmal (G L G)
Mountain, Keeping Still (L G G)
Earth, the Receptive (G G G)

So limitation (G L G G L L) is Water (G L G) over Lake (G L L) and Darkening (G G G L G L) is Earth (G G G) over Fire.
